## Research Experiences

### Project Leader, Undergraduate Innovation Project, Beijing Jiaotong University
*May 2024 - May 2025*  
Advisor: Prof. Hang Zhou (Associate Professor, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University)  
#### A Low- and High-Frequency Fusion Framework for Anti-UAV Detection and Tracking 3333  
- Proposed a low-high frequency fusion framework for anti-UAV detection and tracking
  in low-light and dynamic-background scenarios.  
- Designed the Decoupling Light and Reconstructing (DLR) module to disentangle illumination cues
  and extract light-source-aware low-frequency features, improving robustness to lighting variation.  
- Developed the Null Space Super-Resolution Model (NSRM) module to recover high-frequency motion
  details via null-space decomposition and super-resolution, boosting accuracy for fast-moving UAVs.

### Research Intern, Institute for AI Industry Research (AIR), Tsinghua University
*Jan 2025 - present*  
Advisor: Prof. Yan Wang (Assistant Professor, Institute for AI Industry Research, Tsinghua University)
#### Long-term Sequence Robot World Model Navigation
*Sep 2025 - present*  
- Proposed changing the reasoning paradigm to address the drift problem in autoregressive long-term
  sequence generation, while maintaining the accuracy of the conditional embedding.  
- Explored better compression methods than the sliding window approach to address the problem of context
  forgetting.
#### VLA for Robot Manipulation and Navigation
*Apr 2025 - Jul 2025*  
- Surveyed robotics and embodied learning, focusing on VLA policy learning and diffusion and flow matching-based action generation.  
- Reproduced the π0 codebase and validated the execution pipeline end-to-end.
#### Diffusion Models for Inverse Problems
*Jan 2025 - Mar 2025*  
- Surveyed diffusion and Flow Matching theory and used it to guide model design for fast image generation.  
- Reproduced a Shortcut single-step diffusion model on canonical inverse problems.

## Work Experiences

### Algorithm Intern, Wuxi Research Institute of Applied Technologies, Tsinghua University
*Jul 2025 - Aug 2025*  
#### VLA and World Models for Robot Manipulation and Navigation ####  
- Integrated a robotic arm and multi-sensor stack (camera, force and torque) in ROS2,
  and debugged end-to-end communication for stable runtime operation.  
- Implemented model-to-control interfaces for VLA models (π0-series and world-model inference),
  enabling direct execution of predicted actions on the robot.  
- Validated grasping, placement, and container-operation demos with sim-to-real consistency by unifying
  observation and action formats and task scripts.
